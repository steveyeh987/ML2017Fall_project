Machine Learning Final Project: Listen and Translate
Team: 溫妮孝周的老公

Scripts:
    2 of all:
    - model.py: Dual LSTM based retrieval model implementation
    - reproduce.py: Kaggle reproduce implementation

Requirements:
    - Python 3
    - gensim
    - keras
	- tensorflow
	- scikit-learn
    - pandas
	- numpy

Files:
    All required files should be named as follows and be in the same folder as scripts:
	- train.data
    - train.caption
	- test.data
    - test.csv
	- model.h5

Descriptions of scripts:
    - model.py:
        - Execution:
			python3 model.py train.data test.data train.caption test.csv predict_path
		- Output:
			Generate a keras model file (model.h5) and write the prediction to the file (predict_path.csv) at the end.
	
	- reproduce.py:
        - Execution:
			python3 reproduce.py model.h5 predict_path
		- Output:
			Write the prediction to the file (predict_path.csv) at the end by loading the pretrained model.
